# What's an algorithm?

An algorithm is a mathematical method of solving problems both big and small. Though computers run algorithms constantly, humans can also solve problems with algorithms. David J. Malan explains how algorithms can be used in seemingly simple situations and also complex ones.

## 🔍 1. 盲听抓主旨

> 现阶段没办法做到记录主题、观点

- **我确定听到的词**：computer science、What's an algorithm、instruction、step-by-step
- **我猜他在说**：算法

## ✍️ 2. 逐句听写

1、What's an algorithm. In computer science, an algorithm is a set of instructions for solving some problem, step-by-step.

- 弱读：
  - for：[fɔ:r] -> [fər]
  - an：[æn] -> [ən]
- 连读：
  - What's an algorithm -> [wɑ:tsənælgrɪðəm]
  - is a set of -> [ɪzəsetəv]

2、Typically, algorithms are executed by computers, but we humans have algorithms as well.

- 弱读：
  - as well：[æzwel] -> [əzwel]
  - have：[hæv] -(懒音)> [həv] -(击穿)> [əv]
  - are：[ɑ:r] -(懒音)> [ər]
- 连读
  - algorithms are：[ˈælɡərɪðəmsər]
  - humans have：['hju:məzəv]
  - algorithms as：[ˈælɡərɪðəmsəz]

## 📚 3. 重点语言积累

- algorithm [ˈælɡərɪðəm]：n. 算法，运算法则
- instruction [ɪnˈstrʌkʃn]：n. 指令
- computer [kəm'pjutɚ]：n. 电脑，计算机
- as well [æzwel] - [əzwel]：adv. 也；同样地
- typically [ˈtɪpɪkəli]：adb. 一般地；通常

## 🗣️ 4. 跟读任务

- 跟读第一句话 5 遍
- 跟读第二句话 5 遍
